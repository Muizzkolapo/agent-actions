# retry Command

The `retry` command re-runs failed or exhausted records from an action forward, instead of re-running the whole workflow. Use [`dispositions`](./dispositions) first to see what is stuck and where.

```bash
agac retry -a <workflow-name> [options]
```

## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-a, --agent TEXT` | Agent configuration file name without path or extension (required) |
| `--from TEXT` | Action to retry from. If omitted, retries from the earliest failure |
| `--record TEXT` | Restrict retry to a single record (by `source_guid`) at the `--from` action |
| `--dry-run` | Show what would be retried without executing |

## Examples

### See what would be retried

Always safe — nothing executes:

```bash
agac retry -a my_workflow --dry-run
```

When nothing is stuck it reports `No failed or exhausted records found. Nothing to retry.`

### Retry from the earliest failure

```bash
agac retry -a my_workflow
```

### Retry from a specific action

```bash
agac retry -a my_workflow --from extract_facts
```

### Retry a single record

```bash
agac retry -a my_workflow --from extract_facts --record 3f9a1c2e-...
```

`--record` takes the identifier shown in the **Record ID** column of [`dispositions --quarantined`](./dispositions) — retry matches against exactly that value.
